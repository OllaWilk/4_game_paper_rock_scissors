# üéÆ "Rock, Paper, Scissors": Game in JavaScript
The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game is a simple web application game. Thanks to its implementation in JavaScript, the game operates directly in the web browser, offering an interactive gameplay experience without the need for additional software. Users engage in a challenge against the computer, choosing one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors.

## ‚ú® Project structure

1. index.html - the HTML code file that forms the skeleton of the application,
2. css/style.css - the CSS stylesheet defining the appearance of the application,
3. js/script.js - the JavaScript file containing the game's logic,
4. js/functions.js - auxiliary JavaScript functions used in the game.

## :panda_face: Installation and Launch

The game does not require installation. To launch the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Alternatively, the project can be placed on a web server and made available online.

## :racehorse: Project Development
Potential directions for project development include:

1. Adding advanced strategies for the computer to make the game more challenging,
2. Implementing different levels of difficulty,
3. Creating a high score ranking based on cookies or local storage in the browser,
4. Developing the user interface, e.g., by adding animations.
